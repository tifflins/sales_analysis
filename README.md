The project is to develop a sales analysis dashboard using SQL and Tableau. The dashboard will provide insights into the company's sales performance by analyzing sales data for the last three years. The dashboard will be designed to help the sales team identify trends and patterns in sales data and make data-driven decisions to improve sales performance.
